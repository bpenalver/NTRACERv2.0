# NTRACERv2.0

Develop TF dynamic networks using bioluminescent data obtained from TRACER. The dynamic networks are obtained by a structure optimization procedure of an initial network obtained from a combination of inference methods and prior knowledge.

This code was developed for generating the networks available in the following paper
